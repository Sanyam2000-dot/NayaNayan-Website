                <p>When I was a child I saw certain rituals, syndromes and certain cultures, which I was made to believe and follow at my home in the name of good<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> manners. I did question a few things and tried to understand the reason behind these practices but certain questions were so sacred that talking about them felt like taking "VOLDEMORT'S" name in a/the common room.
                    Such ignorance created a kind of fear in my mind which made me feel like whatever was coming out of my body was part of an atom bomb.
                    
                    For a long time, I kept the questions to myself but gradually, I began thinking deeper. I developed a lot of questions, a lot of queries. Why did the medical owner shout at me if i asked for sanitary napkins in a normal voice and didn't shush it down?
                    Why did he take me to a corner and wrap the napkins in a black polythene?
                    Why I had to fake a flush whenever I was opening the wrapper of a sanitary pad?
                    What would have happened if someone did hear the noise?
                    Why were all the females in our house supposed to be in the kitchen when the guests arrived? 
                    Why were the males supposed to be in the main room?
                    And why did it leave a bad impression about that one female who was not in the kitchen?
                    Why was a husband called "henpecked" for doing the house chores as his wife does if the house belongs to both?
                    Why did the males in the house never get emotional when all of us have those feelings?
                    Why did my parents or my friends' parents never allow therapy when we needed? Why did i always hear that depression was a myth from every adult around me?
                    Why did the folks ask a victim to lose the meaning of her life because of a mishappening while the attacker was allowed to live freely?
                    Why weren't we taken for the health checkups regularly for private parts when diseases like breast cancer could have been controlled in the early stages?
                    Why was it the male's responsibility to earn for the house?
                    
                    And why did nobody ever ask these questions?
                    
                    I am sure I am not the only one who faced a childhood like this.
                    But this in no way implies that our future generation should live this way too.
                    
                    We all have some purpose to serve in this world but the common purpose we have is to leave a secure, better and happy world behind and we can achieve this by asking the right questions and implementing the right answers.

We have been hearing from school time, "No or half-knowledge is dangerous in life". Then why we avoid talking or teaching the most important knowledge which can keep every one of us safe – SEX EDUCATION. If just providing the right and proper knowledge can save people from suffering then Why not? 
                    It’s time we understand, Sex education is as normal as making a child understand that touching a hot pan can burn his hand. It is our right and part of our lives, if not it would not have even existed. At a point in life, we all experience sexuality then why not adopt precautions and share with others too, to avoid any risk and make it pleasurable.
                    Since childhood whenever I was in any dilemma sharing and talking about it always got me a solution or at least made me comfortable with the situation no matter how big or small. So… No more hush-hush, no more whispering! Let’s come forward, Let’s talk about it.

            <div class="col-md-12 ">

                <p>The term "RAPE" is primarily perceived only as "sexual behaviour" since it overlooks the violence that accompanies the action.<span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">The United Nations defines violence against women as “any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life”.
                    According to the studies of the united nations most common type of rape in India is "gang rape" where a group of people sexually abuse the victims and the main reason for the sexual violence is in  the patriarchic culture in Indian history. " The dominant forms of masculinity and femininity are powerful, however, men mostly employ violence and rape to preserve their position of power in certain communities ". These lines are stated in Goonesekere volume. In India gang rapes mostly occurs when the women are visible in a sphere that is dominated by the men especially in certain places men consider as their territory. And the hatred fact is although women are victims and have the right to enter such territories; they are the ones who are blamed by society either partially or fully. 
                    The patriarchy of Indian culture founds a flaw in women like their showy clothing. But they don't find the flaw in the men harassing women directly or indirectly. In Indian society; the worst fact is men involved in sexual violence are trying to be saved by society while the victim women are supposed to be blamed. The rape statistics of India state a minimum of 88 rape cases happen in India daily. If the social attitude towards rape cases patriarchy system and 'blame victim and spare criminal' strategy won't change; then the future ahed of us will definitely be in  darkness. 
                    In the end, the question is "Will society accept this flaw and change it or continue with the current and destroy the whole thing?"</span></p>
